  <p>Veterans Affairs Canada has been overestimating the number of Canadian veterans for decades — and newly released census
    numbers suggest there may be 25 per cent fewer veterans than the federal government previously thought.</p>

  <p>Statistics Canada and Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) are scrambling to reconcile the difference between their numbers, CBC News has learned.</p>

  <p>According to the 2021 census, there are 461,240 veterans in Canada — a huge decline from the 617,800 former military members projected by VAC.</p>

  <p>The explanation may lie in the way that VAC and Statistics Canada count veterans.</p>

  <p>The most recent census contained a question about military service for the first time in 50 years. It asked respondents who were 17 years of
    age or older on May 11, 2021 whether they had ever served in the Canadian military.</p>
